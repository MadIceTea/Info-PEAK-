Week 12 was initially submitted directly to you in paper form, which is why it is not turned in digitally, say as a scan.

I had forgotten about this for a bit, and had a minor panic attack, so I am submitting this here to remind myself that it has been turned in, and that I need to look into amending my answer for the 2nd (optional) question slightly when I re-do the assignment later this week.
