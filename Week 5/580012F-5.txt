Quiz in the slides:
Seems to have been no quiz this time.
=========================================
First program: Embedded box design

#This starts the embedded box problem (Problem 1) in Week 5.
#This program has been optimized for the input of "BoxImageHw(8)".

load("./make2d_color.rb")

def BoxImageHw(s)
  image = make2d_color(s,s)
  for x in 0..(s-1)
     for y in 0..(s-1)
        image[y][x]=[1,0,0] # paint red
       #If (x,y) is within some box, then paint white or light blue
        if inBox(x,y,s/5,s/5,s/1.25,s/3)
          image[y][x]=[1,1,1] #paints white
		end
		if inBox(x,y,s/5,s/2.5,s/1.25,s/1.5)
           image[y][x]=[0,1,1] #paints light blue
		end
     end
   end
image
end
   
def inBox(x,y,a,b,c,d)
    a<=x && x<=c && b<=y && y<=d
end
=========================================
Second program: Animated Circle (too bad I can't save as a GIF file)

#This starts the Circle Animation problem (Problem 2) in Week 5.
#There should be a lesson in why lines 11 and 12 must start with the "s-" part.
#This took me about an hour to figure out finally.
#When you see the difference after an hour, you might feel like this guy "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZHvd0ks7Es"
#Sample image included was ran at circle(100,2016)

include(Math)
load ("./make2d.rb")

def circle(s,n)
 t = 2*s+1
 image = make2d(t,t)
	 for p in 0..(n-1)
	 theta = p*2*PI/n
	 y = s-(0.5*t*(sin(theta)))
	 x = s-(0.5*t*(cos(theta)))
	 image[y.to_i][x.to_i] = 1
	 show(image)
	 end
image
end
=========================================
Third program was optional, and with time constraint, I must opt to skip it.
=========================================
Fourth program: The random circles

#This starts the random circle problem (Problem 4) in Week 5.
#This program was ran at "show randomcircle(100)"

include(Math)
load ("./make2d_color.rb")

def randomcircle(s)
a = rand(s)
b = rand(s)
r = rand(s)
c = [rand(),rand(),rand()]
image = make2d_color(s,s)
	for x in 0...(s-1)
	for y in 0...(s-1)
	image[y][x]=[0,0,0]
		if inCircle(x,y,a,b,r)
		image[y][x] = c
		end
	end
end

def inCircle(x,y,a,b,r)
(x-a)**2+(y-b)**2 <= r**2
end

image
end
