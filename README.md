# Info-PEAK-
A collection of the (interactive) Ruby files used in the Information Science class in PEAK, The University of Tokyo. All are as written by Alex TW and should not be copied exactly for any future assignments by the same teacher or otherwise. (However, using these files as an inspiration for your own project is fine.)
